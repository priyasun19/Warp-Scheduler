# Warp-Scheduler
This paper evaluates warp scheduling algorithms on TLB-enabled GPUs. Rodinia benchmark is used for evaluating the performance of GPUs. The paper also analyzes the impact of schedulers on cache and TLB behaviour. Results show that cache and TLB concious scheduling schemes performs better than traditional schedulers.
